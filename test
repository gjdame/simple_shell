Recently, myself and a group of students at Holberton School for Software Engineering, along with the help of cloud security expert Evelyn de Souza, began a 12-week project focused on blockchain technology. We were tasked with creating a working concept to solve a current societal issue using blockchain technology. We settled on creating a series of smart contracts to track gun ownership. More about the conceptulization of the project can be found in a previous blog post here. 

Our initial post created some fantastic discussion about the idea, with a wide range of opinions on the efficacy of the project. One of the common themes of concerns surrounding the concept centered on the notion of privacy. There has been long standing fear among many gun owners that a national database of guns would lead to law enforcement tracking owners and potentially end in mass seizures of guns, similar to what happened in Australia in the late 90’s. Currently, the federal government is prevented from having any sort of gun owner registry and finding sales records can best be described as archaic. 

There is also the question of the blockchain itself. How can a public ledger be created to not expose personal data about owners, how many guns they posses, their mental health, etc? There is power in the imutability of security of the transactional data of the blockchain, but obviously nobody would want excess personal data exposed because they purchased a gun. 

Fortunately, there are potential solutions to such issues. It is possible to create security layers across a blockchain to obscure identifiable personal information of persons involved in a transaction. This is already being implemented on JP Morgan’s Quorum blockchain through their partnership with Zcash’s zero-knowledge security layer technology. While blocking the information outside of the transactional data, the technology allows for accountants to audit information on those transactions through the use of private keys. 

How could this work on a blockchain for gun ownership? Publicly, no personal information regarding the owner after the purchase of a gun would identifiable. Information regarding the manufacturer, dealer, or number of times ownership changed could still be public. Law enforcement would have the ability to access gun owner’s information, but only through the use of a private key. Access to the key could require a warrant to be obtained. Gun dealers would only see whether a person qualifies for a purchase or not. Nothing more or less. Such a system could adequately balance the need for adequately keeping track of gun ownership while managing privacy of owner’s individual rights and not allowing law enforcement to overreach. 

Security layers such as the one described above, go well outside the bounds of our initial proof of concept, but it is important to highlight that blockchain technology could balance privacy of individuals with the security of a distributed ledger. 

Our group hoes to further advance the discussion with future blog posts about the progress of our concept along with additional information regarding the ultimate use of blockchain technology and gun  ownership.
